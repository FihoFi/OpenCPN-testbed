The DR plugin is for editing gpx files that have been saved on your pc. 
The route name is the name of the route within the GPX file.

1. Use Route Manager to export the route GPX.
2. Open DR and set the parameters.
3. Using DR_pi (Generate) select the GPX you exported.
4. With the second file dialogue save the GPX+DR as a different GPX file.
5. Use Route Manager to import the route + DR positions.
